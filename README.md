### Overview:

Incident Report Log (v. 1) - MERN Stack

This is a full stack web application built with React.js, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. The application is intended to help businesses and insurance companies record and visualize what would otherwise be data stored away in a file cabinet. The application allows businesses to input their data via a form which will then be stored in the database and displayed visually in charts and tables. The businesses only have access to their specific data which is pulled during each session using their user ID. Unlike the business interface, the insurance companies will have access to all the data entered by any business which will solely represent the data visually in charts and graphs displaying average costs and industries at risk.
